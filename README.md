### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Harry! Just Harry!
#### Software Developer

There was once a student of Technology who fell in love with development, and over time, realized that this was his place!
With all his knowledge in Node, he developed practical and performant backends!  Everyone around him knew about his potential, so they supported him... 

Now, I have knowledge in MicroServices, environment configurations and agile development!

Skills: NEXT JS / REACT / VUE JS  / JS / TS / HTML / CSS / DOCKER / RABBIT / AWS
